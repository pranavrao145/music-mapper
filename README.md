# MusicMapper
Interactive GUI to generate song recommendations based on an input song and
display the results in the form of a graph with similarity scores. Final
project for the CSC111 course at the Faculty of Arts and Science, University of
Toronto.

### Prerequisites
All of the Python libraries required for this project to function are listed in the `requirements.txt` file in the project folder; installation of any special libraries is not required. The datasets for this project are provided under `datasets.zip`. This zip file should be unzipped to reveal folders named `data/` and `minimal_data/`, which should be placed on the same level as `main.py`.

### Getting Started
Run the `main.py` file to use the application. An interactive tkinter interface should pop up in the desktop.

Next, input a valid song-artist pair found in the dataset (the inputs are case-sensitive) and use the spinbox to generate the specified number of songs.

Finally, click the "Create Playlist" button to generate the song graph.
